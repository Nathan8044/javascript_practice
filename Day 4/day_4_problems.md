# Practice Problems for Javascript & Python Day 4


Day 4 of Javascript Practice will go over Objects. We will be using Objects, and updating objects. 


Some Review before we get started
```
Object Example: 

const fav_colors = {

    Nathan: Green 
    Henry: Purple
    Umme: Yellow 

}

There are two methods for modifying what is in a object in Javascript

- Dot Method 

    console.log(fav_colors.Nathan) = Green

- Bracket Method 

    console.log(fav_colors['Nathan']) = Green
