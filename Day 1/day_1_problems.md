# Practice Problems for Javascript & Python

## Problem 1:

Sam wants to make his own peppermint chocolate chip cookies. However, she has a random number of ingredients and does not know if she can make it. 

One cookie will contain these ingredients: 

| Ingredients | Amount | Unit |
|-------------| ------ | ---- |
| Sugar | 1/2 | tsp |
| Chocolate Chip | 3/4 | Cups |
| Candy Canes | 5 | Cups |
| Flour | 1 and a half | Cups | 
| Vanilla Extract | 3 | tsp | 

The user must be prompted for values of  sugar, chocolate chip, candy canes, flour, vanilla extract. From these values you will determine how much cookies you can make from the inputted values. 

You are also accounting for if the user does not input any values at all. For example, if the user inputs that they have 1 tsp of sugar, but no vanilla extract then you cannot make a cookie. **Hint you need to check for 'if' all requirements are met and then you have a peppermint cookie. Then, from there,calculate how many cookies you can make from that amount. 





```
Input:

Example 1:
Sugar: 5
Chocolate Chip: 3 
Candy Cane: 15
Flour: 6
Vanilla: 9

Example 2: 

Sugar: 0
Chocolate Chip: 2
Candy Cane: 67
Flour: 97
Vanilla: 17
-----------------------------------------------------------
Output: 

Example 1: You can make 3 cookies!!!!!!!!

Example 2: No cookies for you!
