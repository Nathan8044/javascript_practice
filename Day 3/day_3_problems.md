# Practice Problems for Javascript & Python Day 3



In day 3, using the conditional statements, lops and arithmetic learned in the first day. To accelerate the learning process we will jump to using function and getting functions to work in conjunction with a math arithmetic problem. 

The point of this lesson is to understand the different scopes, for this day we will be looking at the global and functions scope to keep things more simple. The other scopes are included within this section if needed, but they will be looked over more in depth. 

Some Review before we get started: 

```
Using if statements

    if (conditional name) {
        
        Insert function within statement 


    }

Using if & else statements 

    if (conditional name) {

        Insert function within statement is if statement is true

    } else {

        Insert function if the if statement is false 
    }

Using if, else if, & else statements 

    if (conditional name) {

        insert function if this if statement is true 

    } else if {

        Insert function if the first if statement above fails or    
        any other "else "if" statements do not work 

    } else {

        insert code for if all else fails 

    }

Writing Functions in Javascript: 


function function_name([parameters]) {

    // code to be executed 

}

Example of functions: 

    functions Math(x, y) {

        var result = x + y

        return result


    }

    console.log(result)





```
